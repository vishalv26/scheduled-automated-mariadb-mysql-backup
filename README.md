* keep_days is the amount of days that the script will keep files. (Default last 3 days files)

tables_truncate_after_dump
* It's an array of tables that will be truncated after the dump. Can be used if you want to truncate a log table. Do not split with comma use only white space. Example tables_truncate_after_dump("table1" "table2")

# Add Permission
